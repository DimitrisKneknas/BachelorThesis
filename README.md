## Abstract

The goal of this thesis was to develop a predictive model that calculates a **Safe Driving Behavior Index** based on driving data. A Stacking Regressor was implemented, consisting of 7 Gradient Boosting models as base models and a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) as the meta-model. The project involved data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation to provide reliable predictions of driver safety.
