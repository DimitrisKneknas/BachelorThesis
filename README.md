## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
This project presents a **machine learning-based model** for predicting safe driving behavior by integrating **real-time driving and weather data**. The goal is to improve **road safety assessment** by leveraging **advanced predictive modeling techniques**.  

## ðŸš€ Key Features  
- **Data Integration**: Combines driving data (speed, acceleration, etc.) with weather conditions.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements **Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and Ensemble Learning** techniques.  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Utilizes **Optuna** to fine-tune model performance.  
- **Ensemble Learning**: Uses **Voting, Stacking, and Bagging Regressors** to enhance robustness.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compares models based on accuracy and stability under different conditions.  

## ðŸ“Š Results  
âœ… **Gradient Boosting outperformed Neural Networks** in driving safety prediction.  
âœ… **Ensemble techniques improved model stability and accuracy.**  
âœ… The model successfully predicts safe driving scores, considering **individual behavior and environmental conditions**.
